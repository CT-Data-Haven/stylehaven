#' @title Prepare chart labels that should be repelled apart
#' @description This function is designed for plots, particularly dot plots,
#' where some values are very close together and need to be pushed apart in
#' order to avoid overlaps. It returns just the columns needed to know which
#' points should be dodged apart.
#'
#' It doesn't calculate new positions for those pointsâ€”
#' that depends on your specific use, but `ggrepel::geom_text_repel` is likely
#' what you'll use with this. You'll probably call this to get a data frame
#' of the points that should be dodged, then use `dplyr::semi_join` on the
#' original data to plot the points that *do* need to be dodged, and
#' `dplyr::anti_join` for the ones that *don't* need to be dodged (see example).
#' @param data A data frame
#' @param x Bare name of the column being plotted on the independent axis
#' @param value Bare name of the dependent variable
#' @param group Bare column name of the grouping variable, likely used for
#' point color
#' @param thresh Numeric: the threshold value of the difference between points.
#' Any pair of points with a difference of less than `thresh` will be
#' considered too close, and will be included in the output as points to dodge.
#' @param digits Number of digits to round to before calculating differences
#' between points. Default: 2
#' @param verbose Boolean: if `TRUE`, will report the number of observations being dodged. Defaults `FALSE`.
#' @return A data frame of too-close points, with columns corresponding to the
#' `x` and `group` columns.
