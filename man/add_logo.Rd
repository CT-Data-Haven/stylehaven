\title{Easily add a logo to a ggplot}
\usage{
add_logo(
  plot,
  image = NULL,
  position = c("right", "left"),
  height = 0.05,
  place_inside = TRUE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{plot}{A \code{ggplot} object onto which the logo will be placed.}

\item{image}{Either a string giving the path or URL to an image file to be
read by \code{magick::image_read}; the results of reading a file or manipulating
an image already with \code{magick::image_read} or other \code{magick} functions;
a \code{ggplot} object / grob; some other object that can be handled by
\code{cowplot::draw_image}; or \code{NULL}, the default. If \code{NULL}, the image will
come from the file at \code{system.file("extdata/logo.svg", package = "stylehaven")}.
As built, this is a logo for DataHaven, but that file can be replaced for
repackaging this library for other organizations or projects.}

\item{position}{String, either "left" or "right", giving the side on which
the logo should be aligned. Default: "right"}

\item{height}{Numeric: the height of the logo, as a percentage of the height
of the image given in \code{plot}. Adjust as necessary based on the dimensions
of the logo. Default: 0.05}

\item{place_inside}{Logical: if \code{TRUE} (default), logo will be drawn within
the plotting area; otherwise, an additional grob is built below the plot,
meaning the logo could later be cropped away, which may be undesirable.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{cowplot::draw_grob} if attaching
a grob, or to \code{cowplot::draw_image} otherwise.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object.
}
\description{
This function wraps around a few functions from \code{cowplot} and
\code{magick} to add a logo (or other annotation) to the bottom of a \code{ggplot} plot,
an otherwise tedious and easy to forget process. It's meant to be flexible in
the types of objects it can place; as a result, it's less flexible in their
placement and customization. For more specific needs, the source of this
function should be easy to build upon.
