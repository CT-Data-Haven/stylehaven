This is a collection of style utilities mostly revolving around making clean labels for legible plots and examples of building common plots, intended for in-house use at DataHaven. There's not a whole lot to it, probably never will be, just a collection of utilities, examples, and some best(?) practices related to plotting.

This branches out from Nathan Kim's (@18kimn) work developing our first steps at a styleguide as an intern.

## Installation

You can install stylehaven from GitHub:

``` r
remotes::install_github("CT-Data-Haven/stylehaven")
```

See vignettes for examples.
